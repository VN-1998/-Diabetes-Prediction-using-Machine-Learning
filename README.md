# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health parameters. By applying different machine learning algorithms, the system helps identify patterns in the dataset and provides accurate predictions that could assist in early diagnosis and better healthcare planning.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used contains multiple health-related features such as:
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- BMI
- Age
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- And other relevant parameters

*(Dataset Source: Public diabetes dataset — e.g., PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset)*

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Import dataset and understand structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize patterns, correlations, and trends.
4. **Model Training** – Apply multiple classification algorithms.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Prediction** – Use the trained model to predict diabetes risk for new data.

## 📊 Results
- Compared performance of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Visualized feature importance to identify key health parameters affecting diabetes prediction.
- Achieved best results with **Random Forest Classifier**.
